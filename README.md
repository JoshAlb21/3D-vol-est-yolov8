# Project: 3D Volume Estimation by leveraging instance seegmentation results on 2D images

**Volume Estimation Settings**: Users can set parameters for volume estimation, such as millimeters per pixel, fallback polynomial degree, and the number of orthogonal lines.

Presents a skeletal image with orthogonal lines and a 3D volume visualization.
